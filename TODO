List of things that I think that would be nice to have in usbview:

(feel free to submit patches to implement these :)

- fix the potential buffer overflows (there are at least one of these, but 
  since usbview isn't running suid, the worst thing that can happen is 
  crashing the program.)

- remove [Refresh] button and replace it with select(1) to track changes
  in real time. (kinda done, if kernel is > 2.4.0-test8, refresh happens
  automatically.)

- change layout to look something like gproc (removing the buttons and
  right info bar, only having a tree.) The device info would be accessed
  differently (come on, who really reads all of that stuff all the time...)

- make into a Gnome applet.
